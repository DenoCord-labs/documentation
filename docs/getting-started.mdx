Lets Create a Basic Bot using DenoCord

```ts
import { Client } from "https://deno.land/x/denocordts/mod.ts";

const client = new Client({
  token: "TOKEN", // enter your bot's token here
  clientId: "ID", // enter your bot's id here
  intents: ["Guilds", "GuildMessages", "GuildMembers", "MessageContent"], // message content intent is required for the bot to get the content of the message
});

client.on("Ready", () => {
  console.log(`Logged in as ${client.user.username} at ${new Date()}`);
});

client.on("MessageCreate", async (message) => {
  if (message.content.toLowerCase() === "!ping") {
    await message.reply({ content: `Pong!\n${client.ping}ms` });
  }
});
```

<H3>Understanding the Code</H3>

```ts
import { Client } from "https://deno.land/x/denocordts/mod.ts";
```

> We're Importing the Client class from the DenoCord library. Client is the main class that handles all the events. It takes 3 arguments
>
> - token &rarr; The Token of the bot which is required to interact with the discord's api. You can get one from [here](discord.com/developers/applications)
> - clientId &rarr; The id of the bot.
> - intents &rarr; The intents, it takes in a list of intents. You'll only recieve events whose intents are passed to the client. For Example: `MessageContent` intent will provide you with the `content` property on `Message` class.

```ts
const client = new Client({
  token: "TOKEN", // enter your bot's token here
  clientId: "ID", // enter your bot's id here
  intents: ["Guilds", "GuildMessages", "GuildMembers", "MessageContent"], // message content intent is required for the bot to get the content of the message
});
```
> We're instantiating Client with the proper values. If you provide a wrong token the process will exit showing you the relevant error message.

```ts
client.on("Ready", () => {
  console.log(`Logged in as ${client.user.username} at ${new Date()}`);
});
```
> We're listening to the `Ready` event, this event will be emitted when we successfully connect with discord's api. `client.user` will contain data about the client and will be populate after client is ready.

```ts
client.on("MessageCreate", async (message) => {
  if (message.content.toLowerCase() === "!ping") {
    await message.reply({ content: `Pong!\n${client.ping}ms` });
  }
});
```

> Here we're listening to the `MessageCreate` event, this event will be emitted when a message in sent in any channel which bot can see. This event will not be emitted when message is sent by the client/bot (thats the expected behaviour lol.). The `MessageContent` intent will return a `content` string which can be excessed by `message.content`. Here we're checking if message's content is `!ping` if it is reply with a message.
