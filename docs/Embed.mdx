If you've used Discord for a white you should've seen some special messages sent by users with a `Bot` `✅ Bot` tag.

They look something like this.

![embed](/docs/embed.png)

They're called embeds.

Lets Create one using DenoCord

```ts
import { Embed } from "https://deno.land/x/denocordts/mod.ts";

const embed = new Embed()
  .setTitle("DenoCord")
  .setDescription("An Object Oriented Discord Api Wrapper for Deno.")
  .setColor("RANDOM")
  .setTimestamp();

client.on("MessageCreate", async (message) => {
  if (message.content === "!info") {
    await message.reply({ embeds: [embed] });
  }
});
```


Output:

    <H3> Points to Keep in mind when working with embeds </H3>
    - Embeds can have maximum 25 fields
    - If you've added footer and timestamp at the same time they will be rendered in the same line and timestamp will be at second position. They will be separated by `|` or `•`
